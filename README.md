Fuzzy set theory, introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in 1965, extends classical set theory by allowing elements to have degrees of membership rather than a strict binary classification (belonging or not belonging). A fuzzy set is characterized by a membership function that assigns each element a value between 0 and 1, representing its degree of membership.

The aim of the project is to study happiness in different countries around the world and to understand how different factors, such as gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, social support, healthy life expectancy and others, influence it. For this purpose, fuzzy cluster analysis is used - Fuzzy C-means, which allows categorizing countries into groups depending on their common characteristics. The program has an additional task as an extension of the algorithm to be able to choose the number of clusters for grouping.
